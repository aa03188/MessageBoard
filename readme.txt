MessageBoard by aa03188
This is a simple messaging board community. Using devise allows users to create an account, then go ahead and put up messages that others can reply to. It's somewhat a discussion board idea, but simplified.
Users are also allowed to modify and/or delete their posts, but replies on messages can only be deleted.
Logged in a user can contact us if there was any issues they encountered.
